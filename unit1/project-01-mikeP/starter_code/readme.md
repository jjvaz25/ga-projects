Description: My bot will help you learn some basic US history. Ask it questions about US presidents or the original colonies that made up early America and you may get an answer.

Dependencies:
  None

Configuration:
  None

Commands: 

1. Ask out: 'I wonder how many US presidents there have been...' and the bot will provide an answer, regardless if you address it directly. 

2. Ask the bot directly: 'Who is the <rank> president of the United States?' where <rank> is an ordinal number (first, second, third, fourth, etc). For example, 'Who is the first presiedent of the United States?' will return 'George Washington'. 

3. Ask the bot directly if the state you live (provided that you live in a US state) is one of the original 13 colonies that made up the fledgling US. 'Is <state> one of the original 13 colonies?' where <state> is a current US state; this is case sensitive so use capital letters where required or the bot will not recognize the input. For example, 'Is New York one of the original 13 colonies?' would return 'Yes, New York is one of the original 13 colonies'. 

4. Ask the bot directly to show you an image of a random president: 'Show me a president' will return an image of a random president from the collection.
